# Smart Agricultural Bird Pest Control: Utilizing Computer Vision for Pest MAnagement
This project develops a smart bird detection and repellent system to prevent crop damage in agricultural fields. Using computer vision and sound-based repellents, birds are detected and repelled via distress calls or ultrasonic sounds. The system aims to be cost-effective, sustainable, and environmentally friendly.
