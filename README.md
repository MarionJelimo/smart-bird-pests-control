# Smart Agricultural Bird Pest Control: Utilizing Computer Vision for Pest MAnagement

## Abstract
This project focuses on developing a smart bird detection and repellent system aimed at protecting agricultural fields from bird-related crop damage. By leveraging computer vision and sound-based repellent mechanisms, the system will detect birds and trigger distress calls or ultrasonic sounds to scare them away. The solution is designed to be cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and sustainable, reducing the reliance on harmful methods like chemicals or physical barriers. The project begins by collecting a large dataset of bird images using web scraping techniques, which will be used to train the detection model. The project will then evolve to involve the integration of IoT systems for real-time monitoring and automated responses using Raspberry Pi.

## Overview

### Problem Statement
Birds can cause significant damage to agricultural fields, threatening crop yields and food security worldwide. This problem is best illustrated by the 2023 invasion of red-billed quelea birds in Kenya, where farmers may lose up to 60 tonnes of grain as a result of these pests. This situation is worsened by ongoing drought conditions in the Horn of Africa, which have driven quelea to invade cultivated fields in search of food. In fact, the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) estimates that such crop losses amount to $50 million annually across sub-Saharan Africa.

The Kenyan governmentâ€™s response to this issue has included the controversial use of toxic pesticides like fenthion to eradicate quelea populations. While intended to protect crops, this approach raises serious environmental and health concerns, as the indiscriminate nature of these chemicals poses risks to non-target wildlife, particularly endangered raptors, and can lead to ecological imbalances. Furthermore, the rapid breeding capabilities of birds, coupled with their consumption of up to 10 grams of grain daily, highlight the urgent need for sustainable and effective solutions to mitigate the impacts of avian pests on agriculture.

This project seeks to address the broader issue of bird-related crop damage by developing a smart bird detection and repellent system that leverages computer vision and sound-based mechanisms. The system will detect birds and trigger distress calls or ultrasonic sounds to deter them, providing a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to harmful pesticides. The initial phase will involve collecting a comprehensive dataset of bird images through web scraping, which will be utilized to train the detection model. The project will later on evolve to incorporate IoT systems for real-time monitoring and automated responses using Raspberry Pi, empowering farmers to protect their crops while promoting ecological sustainability.

The following sections will detail the data sources, methods, and results of this project, highlighting the significance of technology in modern pest control and its potential impact on agricultural sustainability.
